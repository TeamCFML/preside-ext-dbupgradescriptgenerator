dbupgradescriptgenerator.warning=The following script will attempt to connect to a database, who's details you supply below, and generate a PresideCMS upgrade script based on the current application. This script can then be used to safely upgrade the target environment ahead of an application reload. You should test upgrade scripts on a backup of the live database before running them live and always create a backup of the live database before upgrading. Finally, if you expect issues to arise during migration, you should make use of PresideCMS's maintenance mode during the upgrade process.
